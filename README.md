# Project 1

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

The site can be viewed at <https://info340a-su20.github.io/project-01-madisoncolvin/index.html>

Above is a link to my final project, Speak Out. I have run the code through online validators to confirm that my code compiled without errors. 

The two interactive pieces to the final website design is the form and the gallery view. The form allows users to submit protests to be added to the website. For example, the user will type in information about their upcoming protest,and once the form is submitted the user will receive a personalized message about the protest information they just entered. The gallery is interactive and allows users to flip through images of past protests. In the future the gallery will have other views allowing the user to scroll through multiple images at a time, but for the scope of this course and the interactivity requirement the gallery is a click through, interactive experience. 

In addition to the two interactivity requirements, I have included a csv file that I compiled from kaggle.com with data from shootings by US police. I have incorporated the data via a bar chart at the bottom of my website’s home page. The bar chart graphs the number of shootings per state in 2017. 

On top of these additions, I have also updated my project according to your previous suggestions. I have updated the header image, removed unnecessary br tags and replaced them with appropriate spacing in the CSS file, got rid of the image repeat in the gallery, reworked the CSS so that it would be responsive to mobile devices, and other suggested updates. Overall, these changes improved my user experience and helped me achieve a more cohesive website.

Outside of this project, and if I were to actually implement this app in the real world, the functionality would look a lot different. For example, the add to calendar buttons that are placed throughout the app would add user selected events to their personalized calendar. The calendar would keep track of these events and send the user personalized emails and notifications reminding them of their upcoming event.
Additionally, the gallery would have multiple views instead of the one that I provided, the form submission would give a preview of the created event, and the application would require the user to sign up to use the app. To remain anonymous online, the information provided on the site would only be available to moderators and any identifying information would remain anonymous on the user’s end. 

Overall, I am happy with the way this application turned out and am proud of what I accomplished in such a short quarter. This project pushed me out of my comfort zone and challenged me to learn new things. Thank you so much for a great quarter!
