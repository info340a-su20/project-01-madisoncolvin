    <section>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The last few months have been a monumental and pivotal point in U.S. and 
            world history. We are currently living through the world’s first modern 
            pandemic and are in the midst of the <cite> <a href=
            "https://blacklivesmatter.com">Black Lives Matter</a></cite> movement, a fight 
            against systemic racism in America and for police reform. The unjust murder 
            of George Floyd by the Minniapolois Police Department has sparked protests across 
            the world to combat police brutality, specifically against African-American’s 
            in the United States. The Black Lives Matter movement has created a wave of 
            large-scale protests across the nation in hopes to combat racial injustice 
            and racism that still exists in our country. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Racial injustice is a prominent issue in our current society that needs to be addressed. 
            Recent protests have been organized for individuals to gather and peacefully 
            protest. Personally, I have tried my best to stay involved in the BLM movement by 
            joining peaceful protests in my area. Unfortunately, due to many individuals being 
            unlawfully arrested for their involvement in these peaceful protests there has been 
            a lack of information regarding protests posted online. For example, when searching 
            for locations and times of organized protests on the internet, social media and 
            discussion boards I have found very little information regarding the subject. 
            Despite my research, a majority of the protests I have seen on TV I had not heard 
            about until I was watching the protest in real-time on my local news station.  
        </p>

        <p>   
            Local activist groups have tried to spread the word of protests via Twitter and 
            Reddit, but I feel as though there is still a lack of information available. 
            Posts on Twitter or Reddit are often easily buried and hard for the inexperienced 
            user to find. There needs to be a more accessible, user-friendly way to distribute 
            this information.
        </p> 
    </section>

    <!-- This section describes why the problem described warrants a solution -->
    <section>
        <h3>Why it Needs Addressing</h3>
        <p>
            It is vital to fight the racial injustice that still persists in America. We all deserve 
            equality and it is obvious that we are still far from where we need to be. The first 
            amendment grants citizens the right to peacefully protest and the right to freedom of 
            speech, and we should be able to freely exercise our rights. 
        </p>

        <p>   
            I am sure there are others like me that would love to get more involved, but are struggling
            to find the information online. In order to spark change, I think that it is 
            extremely important to be able to get information about protests out to the 
            public. Right now people are afraid to speak out and scared to share any 
            information about the protests in fear of being arrested. For example, 
            individuals have been extremely concerned about showing their faces at protests 
            in fear of being identified later in video recordings. The majority of these 
            protestors have been peaceful, and have not broken any law, yet police continue 
            to arrest protestors because of their involvement. According to the <cite><a 
                href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-killing-police-arrest-non-violent-protesters">
                Guardian</a></cite>, 
            “more than 10,000 people, many non-violent, have been arrested around the US during the 
            protests, as police forces regularly use pepper spray, rubber bullets, teargas and batons 
            on protesters, media and bystanders.”

    <!-- This section details my proposed solution to the issue -->
    <section>
        <h3>The Proposed Applicaton</h3>
        <p>   
            I am proposing a web application where users can anonymously post when 
            and where protests are taking place in their area. Users can add protests 
            they are interested in participating in to their built in calendar, thus, 
            showing the total number of protestors who plan on attending the event. 
            Additionally, each protest posted will have a discussion board where users 
            can anonymously post information regarding the protest, list of what to bring, 
            and information about the cause. For large scale protests, the website will 
            keep up-to-date information regarding road closures and known police 
            involvement to make sure protestors stay safe while supporting their cause. 
            This ensures that protesters are able to arrive at the protest safely and 
            park outside of enclosed zones, know how to safely leave the protest once it 
            is over, and ensures the safety of the individuals involved.
        </p> 
        <p>   
            The proposed web application will also keep up-to-date information of 
            causes, such as GoFundMe’s, that are in need of donations if users wish 
            to help the cause, but cannot make it out to the protest. The web 
            application will also list petitions that have not yet reached their 
            signee goal for those who are not able to financially contribute.
        </p> 
        <p>   
            The user’s of the application will be individuals who are interested in supporting 
            change in their community, may it be the BLM movement, a women’s march, or a 
            protest for LGBT+ rights. These users wish to gain important information about 
            their protest and may wish to remain anonymous to protect their identity.
        </p> 
        <p>   
            This app will help connect individuals who would love to get more involved, but are 
            struggling to find the information online. This platform will allow people to 
            plan for safe and peaceful protests and aid them in their mission to spark 
            change. The ability for users to post anonymously will take away some of 
            the worry that surrounds being involved in protests, and help get the word 
            out. By creating an all-inclusive space for individuals to organize protests, 
            it will increase overall participation and gain more attention for the cause.
        </p>
